 * The POWERPC ABI does not provide for tail calls. Thus, the math dispatch   *
 * table processing incurs overhead with the saving and restoration of GPR 2  *
 * that can severely affect application performance.  For POWERPC, we use an  *
 * optimized assembly dispatch set of routines that make tail calls to all of *
 * the routines defined in the math dispatch configuration files but do not   *
 * saveand /restore GPR 2.                                                    *
 *                                                                            *
 * !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *
 *                                                                            *
 * If any entry (routine <FUNC>) in any of the dispatch tables is not present *
 * in i.e. not  satisfied by, libpgmath, in order to properly preserve/restore*
 * GRP 2 when calling routine <FUNC>, the actual function must first be       *
 * encapsulated in a routine present in libpgmath.                            *
 *                                                                            *
 * No doubt there are pathological cases that will show this engineering      *
 * choice to be wrong, but current performance testing shows otherwise.       *
